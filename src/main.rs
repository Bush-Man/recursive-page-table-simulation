/*
Bit(s)	Name	                Meaning
0	    present	                the page is currently in memory
1	    writable	            itâ€™s allowed to write to this page
2	    user accessible	        if not set, only kernel mode code can access this page
3	    write-through caching	writes go directly to memory
4	    disable cache	        no cache is used for this page
5	    accessed	            the CPU sets this bit when this page is used
6	    dirty	                the CPU sets this bit when a write to this page occurs
7	    huge page/null	        must be 0 in P1 and P4, creates a 1 GiB page in P3, creates a 2 MiB page in P2
8	    global	                page isnâ€™t flushed from caches on address space switch (PGE bit of CR4 register must be set)
9-11	available	            can be used freely by the OS
12-51	physical address	    the page aligned 52bit physical address of the frame or the next page table
52-62	available	            can be used freely by the OS
63	    no execute	            forbid executing code on this page (the NXE bit in the EFER register must be set)
